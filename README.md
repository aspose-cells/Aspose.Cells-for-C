```

### Create a Custom Excel Chart

```c++

Aspose::Cells::Startup();

// create a new workbook
Workbook workbook;

// get first worksheet which is created by default
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.GetWorksheets().Get(0);

// add sample data
worksheet.GetCells().Get("A1").PutValue(50);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("A2").PutValue(100);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("A3").PutValue(150);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("A4").PutValue(110);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("B1").PutValue(260);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("B2").PutValue(12);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("B3").PutValue(50);
worksheet.GetCells().Get("B4").PutValue(100);

// add a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.GetCharts().Add(Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType::Column, 5, 0, 20, 8);

// access the instance of the newly added chart
Chart chart = worksheet.GetCharts().Get(chartIndex);

// add SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from A1 to B4
